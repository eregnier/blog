Hey !

I had a thought today.

let Microsoft = M$

Does github copilot really costs 20 dollars to github per user like it's 
[said on hn](https://www.google.com/search?q=hacker+news+copilot+cost+20+dolars&oq=hacker+news+copilot+cost+20+dolars) ?

Github belongs to M$, and users using copilot write code and store a large part of it on github. 

Github and M$ benefit to have large developer and codebase numbers to show against other git based companies.

Dealing with huge customer numbers attracts new customers.

New customers brings money on the table, and produce event more code on the platform.

Now let imagine Copilot is a LLM, and based on the most widly spread / used / known one : openai GPT.

Also imagine than M$ is the main investor in open AI and have interest as many people buy, use and produce content from and for open AI,

and now imagine M$ also own another huge code platform that manage / handle large codebases like npm,

and last but not least, imagine a tool that generate metrics to study all of this seemlessly like let say vscode.

Oh W8 !

I have hard time beliving copilot costs M$ 20 $ / user, even if it costs 20 $ / user to github company ðŸ˜ƒ.

I made a simple short list of business relations that I know at my level and I guess there are a lot more.
